## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use Media queries to creat more responsive web designs. Details below:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px){
  main{
    max-width: 99vw;
    min-width: 85vw;
  }
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px){
  main{
    max-width: 40vw;
    min-width: 35vw;
  }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 920px){
  main{
    max-width: 30vw;
    min-width: 25vw;
  }    
}
```


### Continued development

- Getting better at RWD (Responsive Web Designs) especially the use of Media queries and Grid Frameworks


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS RWD Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me in understanding and applying the Media Queries concept. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
